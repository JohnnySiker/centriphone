Initial idea and prototype originally appeared in [a video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWZ1azLPeOlFTngufYH6lng) first published on February 5th 2016.\r\n\r\n[The making of video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d45oGNv8H98) reveals how the effect was achieved and documents the creative process.\r\n\r\n**We want to encourage you to give it a try, further develop the concept and find other ways to use it.**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nVisit [centriphone.me](http://www.centriphone.me)\r\n\r\n\r\nWiki\r\n------------\r\n\r\nWe would love your help expanding our [wiki](https://github.com/centriphone/centriphone/wiki).
